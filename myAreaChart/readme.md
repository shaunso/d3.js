# Area Chart

- Created a one page html document that dynamically draws the graph to Econet Wireless' subscriber growth between Q3 2014 & 2023.

- Used CSSS Grid to layout the document. Used a named 'grid-area' to place the elements onto the grid.

- This was also intended as a refresher for my CSS.

- Also meant to hone my design skills.

- Need to finish off the chart (i.e. ~~the titles & labels~~), ~~the form~~ ~~(with client-side validation)~~ ~~and the footer~~

- First begun this small project on 6 March 2024

- The next step after completing this mini-project is extending the area chart into a stacked area chart comparing the market shares with Econet's competitors.

- Next project I do needs the HTML to follow semantic best practices as practice

- The client-side validation relies on HTML. Need to extend this on the next project to include JavaScript to handle the validation on the client side

- The wireframe for this project is included as an image in order for future me to see how I came up with this layout idea.
