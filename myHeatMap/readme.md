# Heatmap

- created a heatmap using the daily sales data provided by a business

- analysis of sales over a 34 week period

- implented scaleBand() for both axes, as well as scaleThreshold() for the colour scale

- need to read further on how exactly .bandwidth() works

- rather than creating a legend on my own, I opted to use the 'simple' legend scale from `https://observablehq.com/@d3/color-legend` written by the d3.js creator, but in all honesty, this isn't very intuitive of a legend. Will need to read through it more to get a better understanding of how it actually works, but for next time, I will probably opt to build my own.
