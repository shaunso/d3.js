# Choropleth map

This map is displaying the population density of the 90 districts in Zimbabwe using the 2022 census data (population & housing vol).

The data was cleaned wrangled by myself in Excel.

Had to wrangle the TOPOJSON file too.

The chart is responsive thanks to the use of viewbox.
    Need to read more on how this works actually
