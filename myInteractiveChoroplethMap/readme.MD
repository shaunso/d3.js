# Choropleth map

**27-03-24**
-This map is displaying the population density of the 90 districts in Zimbabwe using the 2022 census data (population & housing vol).

-The data was cleaned wrangled by myself in Excel.

-Had to wrangle the TOPOJSON file too.

-The chart is responsive thanks to the use of viewbox.
Need to read more on how this works actually

**28-03-24**
-Learnt that when you format JSON files, that also balloons their file size.
Important to minify the file afterwards to reduce its file size.

--- LEARNING THAT RIGHT NOW, I NEED TO NOT WORRY ABOUT PERFORMANCE.

    GET THE UX YOU WANT FIRST!!!!!

    THEN FOCUS ON PERFORMANCE AFTERWARDS AS I COULD USE CLEVER CSS TRICKS TO CREATE A FLEETING MOMENT OF AN INTERACTION DELAY IN ORDER FOR THE LARGER JSON FILES TO LOAD, IN THE RANGE OF [500ms - 1000ms] IN TIME
