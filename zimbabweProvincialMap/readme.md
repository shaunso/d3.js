# Choropleth Map

- used d3.js to create a choropleth map of Zimbabwe

- the map shows the population by province

- need to practice on draw the colour scale & adding interactivity to the maps

- data for the population sourced from `[https://www.zimstat.co.zw]`

- to get the TopoJSON, I sourced the GEOJSON files from `[https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-zwe]` then used `[https://mapshaper.org/]` to convert the .shp files into TopoJSON

- the Mercator type map was used for the projection
